# Regnum-Skilltrainer

Since there wasn't any skilltrainer for Champions of Regnum i've decided to write one by my own. It's written in C#/WinForms and works on Windows.
You'll need to have .NET framework 4.7.2 or higher installed on your machine to run this application.

If you have any issues feel free to create an issue in this repository or add me on discord: sl1nkz#7526

# Things i want to add in the future
- Possibility to share your created skill builds.
- Add values and description to every skill.

# Special thanks
Special thanks goes to Schwarzer Tee and his clan .::[Dwarves of Erebor]::. for the opportunity to use their Discord and share my work. Join his discord <a href="https://discord.gg/qSspgMCvJU">here</a>
